localstorage is a web technology based on web browser . It's a way to save values in the web browser. for saving the values we used

<div class="my-4">
    
```js
const value = "dbbs"
localstorage.setItem("keyName",value);
```

</div>

for getting an item from the localstorage we use

<div class="my-4">
    
```js
const item = localstorage.getItem("keyName",name);

```

</div>
```

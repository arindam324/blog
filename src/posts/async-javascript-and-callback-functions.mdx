let's discuss first we do we even need asynchronus programming . You might heard before that javascript is a single threaded language which means it can only execute one task at a time.
But what do you do when a particular task takes a bit more time to execute . Then this particular task get added to something called <em>Web Apis </em>(provided by the browser) and the rest of your code get executed as expected.

let's see an example of a asynchronus code.

<div class="my-4">

```js
// this runs after 3 seconds
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("hello world");
}, 3000);
```

</div>

now let's see why do we need callback functions for asynchronus programming . suppost our async code return some type of value.suppose our async code returns a value.let's discuss what is a callback function .

A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument . This function is invoked inside the outer function to complete an action.

<div class="my-4">

```js
function callBack(name) {
  console.log("Hello" + name);
}

function outerFunction(callBack) {
  let name = callBack("Jhon");
}

const greet = outerFunction(callBack);
```

</div>

so might question why do we need callback function .javascript is an event driven language. That means instead of waiting for a response javascript will keep executing while listening for other events. Let's take an example with the first function invoking an API call(simulated by setTimeout) and the next function which logs the message.

<div class="my-4">

```js
function first() {
  // Simulate a code delay
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log("First function called");
  }, 1000);
}
function second() {
  console.log("Second function called");
}
first();
second();

Output:
// Second function called
// First function called
```

</div>

Callback Hell is an anti-pattern with multiple nested callbacks which makes code hard to read and debug when dealing with asynchronous logic. The callback hell looks like below,

<div class="my-4">

```js
  async1(function(){
    async2(function(){
        async3(function(){
            async4(function(){
                ....
            });
        });
    });
});
```

</div>
